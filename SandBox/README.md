# openglSandBox

This is a personal project, the goal of this project is to have a good sandbox for playing with shaders, animations, etc. 

You will find a VERY work in progress fbx parser that use official fbxsdk.

## Getting Started

This project works fine on linux platforms but you should be able to compile on windows as well. 

### Prerequisites

```
GLEW
GLFW
fbxsdk

Sorry for the poor makefile...

```
make
```

And type

```
./shader
```
